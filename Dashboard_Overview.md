# Step 5: Power BI Dashboard Overview

Since I didnâ€™t have access to Power BI Desktop, I created a mock version of the Uber Fares dashboard to show my understanding of key metrics.

This dashboard includes:
- Histogram of fare amounts
- Boxplot to identify outliers
- Ride frequency by hour of the day
- Average fare by day of the week
- Donut chart for monthly fares
- Interactive slicers for time filtering

Below is the preview:
