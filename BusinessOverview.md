# ðŸ“Š Business Overview

Uber aims to improve its pricing strategy and driver availability by analyzing historical ride data. This project explores fare patterns, time-based ride demand, and outliers using Power BI.

By transforming and visualizing this data, we uncover valuable insights such as:
- Peak ride hours and days
- Most common fare ranges
- Variability in demand based on time of day

The findings help support operational planning and strategic decision-making at Uber. This project was done for the course *Introduction to Big Data Analytics â€“ INSY 8413* at AUCA.
