# 📄 Business Overview – Uber Fares Data Analysis

## 🏢 Background

Uber aims to improve its pricing strategy and driver availability by analyzing historical ride data. With millions of daily rides, understanding demand patterns and fare variability is essential for operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Analysis

This project explores fare patterns, time-based ride demand, and pricing outliers using Python and Power BI. The cleaned and enhanced dataset helps uncover meaningful insights such as:

- 📌 Peak ride hours and days
- 📌 Most common fare ranges
- 📌 Variability in demand based on time of day

## 📈 Value of the Project

By transforming and visualizing this data, we support strategic decision-making at Uber in the following areas:
- Optimizing driver scheduling
- Improving dynamic pricing models
- Identifying unusual fare behavior for further investigation

This project was conducted as part of the course **Introduction to Big Data Analytics (INSY 8413)** at **Adventist University of Central Africa (AUCA)** under the guidance of **Mr. Eric Maniraguha**.
